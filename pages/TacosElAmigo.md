The very best tacos I've had in Nashville come from Tacos y Mariscos El Amigo. More than any other tacos al pastor in town, these are juicy and marinated just right. They're just greasy enough and have the authentic addition of chopped pineapple. My exact order:

- Tacos al pastor (at least 2-3)
- "Con todo" will include grilled chopped onions, fresh minced onions, and cilantro.
- Avocado slices
- Cheese (melted, like a white Mexican cheese somewhere between asadero and Oaxaca)
- Rice and beans if feeling really hungry
